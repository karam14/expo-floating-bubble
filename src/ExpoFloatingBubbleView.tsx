 * ExpoFloatingBubbleView Component
 * 
 * This is a placeholder component for the floating bubble functionality.

 * so this component doesn't render any UI elements.
 * 
 * Use the ExpoFloatingBubble module functions instead:
 * - ExpoFloatingBubble.showBubble() to show a floating bubble
 * - ExpoFloatingBubble.showOverlay() to show an overlay window
 * 
 * @returns null - This component doesn't render anything
